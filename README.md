## ü§ñÔ∏è Download Pretrained Models

We provide our pretrained models [here](https://huggingface.co/xyfJASON/ctrlora/tree/main). Please put the **Base ControlNet** (`ctrlora_sd15_basecn700k.ckpt`) into `./ckpts/ctrlora-basecn` and the **LoRAs** into `./ckpts/ctrlora-loras`.
The naming convention of the LoRAs is `ctrlora_sd15_<basecn>_<condition>.ckpt` for base conditions and `ctrlora_sd15_<basecn>_<condition>_<images>_<steps>.ckpt` for novel conditions.

You also need to download the **SDXL-based Models** and put them into `./ckpts/sdxl`. Models used in our work:
